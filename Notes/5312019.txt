5/31/2019 HexaPawn Notes and documenting

-working out numbers logic, have a board set up, working on moving pieces.

-created an update board method that will run after every move, 
updating the location of the pieces, and checking if theres a winning move made

-I MOVED A PIECE, only forward to a blank tile, but it worked.

- created checkMove() method; checks if your selected piece can be moved to the space selected

- checkMove() allowed movement diagonally when it was an illegal move, that's since been fixed.

-setting the map of the board (A,B,C x 1,2,3)

- I BROKE EVERYTHING WHILE TRYING TO IMPLEMENT MY CODE FOR ALL MOVES

-will continue tomorrow or later tonight			12:54PM
